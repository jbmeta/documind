# Local PDF Querying Application Plan

Of course. This is an excellent project to dive into the world of applied AI. Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch will give you a fantastic, hands-on understanding of the entire pipeline.

Here is a comprehensive plan detailing the tech stack, architecture, and step-by-step implementation for your local-first PDF querying application.

-----

## Phase 1: The Foundation (MVP)

The goal of this phase is to build the core functionality: select a folder, process the PDFs, and ask questions to get answers with citations, all running locally on Windows and Mac.

### **1. The Tech Stack**

We'll stick with a Python-centric stack, as it's the undisputed leader in the ML space and has robust libraries for everything we need.

* **Core Language:** **Python 3.10+**
  * **What It Is:** A versatile, high-level programming language.
  * **Its Purpose:** Python is the standard in the AI/ML world because of its simplicity and, most importantly, its vast collection of pre-built libraries that handle the complex math and algorithms needed for AI tasks.
* **Desktop GUI:** **PyQt6** or **PySide6**
  * **Why:** These are Python bindings for the Qt framework, the industry standard for building high-quality, native-looking cross-platform desktop applications. It's powerful and well-documented.
  * **What It Is:** A library that allows you to build desktop applications with Python that look and feel native on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  * **Its Purpose:** This will be used to create the user interface of your applicationâ€”the windows, buttons, text boxes, and other visual elements your users will interact with.
* **PDF Parsing:** **PyMuPDF (Fitz)**
  * **Why:** It is exceptionally fast and accurate for text extraction. Crucially, it can also extract images and metadata, which will be vital for your future goals.
  * **What It Is:** A high-performance Python library for accessing and extracting data from documents like PDFs.
  * **Its Purpose:** This tool does the "heavy lifting" of opening your PDF files and accurately pulling out all the raw text, page by page. It's the first step in getting your documents' contents into a format the AI can work with.
* **Local LLM Server: Ollama**
  * **What It Is:** Ollama is a user-friendly tool that downloads and runs powerful open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) on your personal computer. It wraps the complex model into a simple, local web server.
    **Its Purpose:** It allows your Python application to "talk" to a powerful reasoning engine (like Llama 3) without needing an internet connection or paying for an API. Your app will send it a question and the relevant text, and Ollama will send back a human-like answer.
* **Text Embeddings:** **Sentence-Transformers**
  * **Why:** This library provides an easy way to use state-of-the-art models that convert text chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings). These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
  * **What It Is:** An "embedding model" is a specialized AI that reads a piece of text and converts it into a list of numbers, called a "vector embedding." The key idea is that semantically similar pieces of text will be converted into mathematically similar lists of numbers. Sentence Transformers are a class of models that are very good at this.
  * **Its Purpose:** This is how your application understands the meaning and context of words, not just the words themselves. We use it to turn both your document chunks and the user's question into these numerical representations so we can find the most relevant information in your files, even if the wording isn't an exact match.
  * **Starting Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` - It's small, fast, and provides excellent performance for its size, making it ideal for running locally.
* **Vector Database:** **ChromaDB**
  * **Why:** Vector databases are specialized for storing and searching through embeddings efficiently. Chroma is open-source, runs entirely on your local machine, is easy to integrate with Python, and is designed specifically for RAG applications.
  * **What It Is:** A database that is specifically designed to store and efficiently search through huge numbers of vector embeddings (the lists of numbers from the embedding model).
  * **Its Purpose:** After converting all your document chunks into embeddings, you need a place to store them. When a user asks a question, the vector database allows you to perform an incredibly fast "similarity search" to find the text chunks whose embeddings are mathematically closest to your question's embedding, thus finding the most relevant context.
* **Local LLM Server:** **Ollama**
  * **Why:** Ollama is the simplest way to download, manage, and run powerful open-source LLMs (like Llama 3) locally. It exposes the model via a simple API on your machine, which your Python application can easily call.
* **The LLM (Language Model):** **Llama 3 8B Instruct** or **Phi-3 Mini**
  * **Why:** These are powerful models that are small enough to run on modern consumer hardware (especially with a decent amount of RAM). Ollama automatically handles the complex setup and provides quantized (memory-optimized) versions.

#### **2. The Architecture (How It Works)**

Your application will follow the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern. It's a two-stage process:

1. **Indexing (Once, or when new docs are added):**

      * The application points to a folder of PDFs.
      * It extracts text from each PDF.
      * The text is broken down into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., paragraphs).
      * The embedding model converts each chunk into a vector.
      * These vectors are stored in the ChromaDB, along with the original text and a citation link (e.g., `file_name.pdf, page 4`).

2. **Querying (Every time you ask a question):**

      * You ask a question in the app's interface (e.g., "What was the conclusion of the Q3 report?").
      * The same embedding model converts your question into a vector.
      * The app searches ChromaDB to find the text chunks with vectors most similar to your question's vector. These are the most relevant snippets from your documents.
      * The app then sends a prompt to the local LLM (via Ollama) that includes your original question *and* the relevant text chunks it just found.
      * The LLM uses the provided context to generate a direct answer and returns it to the app to display, along with the citations from the retrieved chunks.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

#### Step 1: Setup and Basic UI

* Install Python. Create and activate a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
* Install libraries: `pip install PyQt6 PyMuPDF sentence-transformers chromadb requests`.
* Set up a basic PyQt6 window. It should have:
  * A button to `Select Folder...`.
  * A status bar or label to show progress (`Indexing file 3 of 10...`).
  * A text input box for your question.
  * A `Submit` button.
  * A main text area to display the results.

### Step 2: The Indexing Pipeline

* When the `Select Folder...` button is clicked, trigger the indexing logic.
* **Scan for PDFs:** Get a list of all `.pdf` files in the selected directory.
* **Initialize ChromaDB:** `client = chromadb.Client()` and create a collection `collection = client.get_or_create_collection("my_documents")`.
* **Loop through PDFs:** For each file:
  * **Extract Text:** Open the PDF with `PyMuPDF`. Iterate through pages and extract text. Store the text page by page.
  * **Chunk Text:** For each page's text, split it into smaller chunks. A good starting point is splitting by paragraphs (`\n\n`). This is better than just splitting by character count, as it preserves context.
  * **Embed and Store:** For each chunk:
    * Generate its embedding using the `SentenceTransformer` model.
    * Store it in ChromaDB. The `add` function lets you store the embedding, the original text (as `document`), and metadata (like `{ "source": "filename.pdf", "page": 4 }`). Use a unique ID for each chunk.

### Step 3: The Querying Pipeline

* When the `Submit` button is clicked:
  * **Get User Query:** Take the text from the question input box.
  * **Embed the Query:** Use the same `SentenceTransformer` model to create an embedding of the question.
  * **Retrieve Context:** Query ChromaDB with the question's embedding to get the top 3-5 most similar chunks: `results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=5)`.
  * **Extract Context and Citations:** Pull the text and metadata from the `results`. The metadata will give you the citations.

#### Step 4: Answer Generation with Ollama

* First, make sure you have **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** installed and have pulled a model: `ollama run llama3`. This will start a local server.

* **Construct the Prompt:** Create a clear, structured prompt for the LLM. This is crucial for getting good answers.

    ```python
    # Example Prompt
    context_str = "\n---\n".join([doc for doc in results['documents'][0]])
    citations = ", ".join([meta['source'] for meta in results['metadatas'][0]])

    prompt = f"""
    You are a helpful question-answering assistant. Your task is to answer the user's question based only on the provided context.
    Provide a clear, concise answer and cite the source documents from which you drew your information.

    CONTEXT:
    {context_str}

    QUESTION:
    {user_question}

    ANSWER:
    """
    ```

* **Call the API:** Use the `requests` library to send a POST request to Ollama's local endpoint (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`).

* **Display the Result:** Parse the JSON response from Ollama and display the answer and the formatted citations in your app's UI.

-----

### **Phase 2: Future Upgrades**

Once you have the MVP working, you can build upon your solid foundation. The tools we've chosen make these extensions very manageable.

#### **1. Handling Images, Charts, and Graphs**

This requires a multimodal model that can "see."

* **Tech:** You'll need a local vision-language model like **LLaVA**. The good news is, Ollama can also run LLaVA (`ollama run llava`).
* **Plan:**
    1. During your indexing step, use `PyMuPDF` to not only extract text but also images from each page (`page.get_images()`).
    2. For each extracted image, send it to the LLaVA model via Ollama with a prompt like "Describe this image in detail."
    3. Take the text description generated by LLaVA (e.g., "This is a bar chart showing Q3 revenue growth...") and embed it just like any other text chunk.
    4. Store this description's embedding in ChromaDB with a citation pointing to the page the image was on.
    <!-- end list -->
  * **Result:** When you ask "What does the revenue chart on page 12 show?", your query will match the text description of that chart, which will be fed to your Llama 3 model as context.

#### **2. Supporting Other Document Formats**

* **Tech:** Add new parsing libraries to your project.
  * For `.docx`: `pip install python-docx`
  * For `.txt`: Python's built-in file handling.
  * For `.html`: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
* **Plan:**
    1. In your indexing logic, create a "dispatcher" function.
    2. Check the file extension of each document (`.pdf`, `.docx`, etc.).
    3. Based on the extension, call the appropriate parsing function (e.g., use `PyMuPDF` for PDFs, `python-docx` for Word files).
    4. The output of each parser should be clean text. From this point on, the rest of the pipelineâ€”chunking, embedding, and storingâ€”remains exactly the same.

This project will be a rewarding journey. Start with Phase 1, get it working end-to-end, and you'll be well on your way to building a powerful and private personal search engine.
Of course. Building a local, private, and intelligent document assistant is a fantastic way to dive into AI and machine learning. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan, breaking down the technology, architecture, and step-by-step implementation.

This plan is designed to start simple and gradually add the more advanced features you're interested in.

### **Phase 1: The Core Q\&A Application**

The goal of this phase is to build a minimum viable product (MVP) that can scan a local folder of PDFs, process them, and answer questions with citations, all on your local machine. This is centered around a concept called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

#### **Recommended Tech Stack**

* **Language: Python**

  * **Why:** It's the undisputed leader in the ML/AI space with an unparalleled ecosystem of libraries that make complex tasks manageable.

* **Desktop GUI Framework: PyQt / PySide**

  * **Why:** These Python bindings for the powerful Qt framework allow you to build a professional, native-looking application that works seamlessly on both Windows and Mac.

* **PDF Processing: PyMuPDF**

  * **Why:** It's exceptionally fast and robust for extracting text. Crucially, it can also extract images, which will be essential for your future goals.

* **AI & ML Components:**

  * **Local LLM Server: Ollama**
    * **Why:** Ollama is the easiest way to download, manage, and run powerful open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 on your local machine. It turns the model into an API that your application can easily call.
  * **Embedding Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**
    * **Why:** This is a small, fast, and efficient model from the Sentence-Transformers library that's excellent at converting text into numerical representations (embeddings) for similarity searching.
  * **Vector Database: ChromaDB**
    * **Why:** To find relevant information quickly, you need to store your text embeddings in a specialized database. ChromaDB is open-source, runs locally, and is built specifically for AI applications, making it very developer-friendly.

#### **The Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

Here is the logical flow for building your application from the ground up.

#### Step 1: Project Setup and UI Scaffolding

1. **Environment:** Set up a new Python project with a virtual environment.
2. **Install Libraries:** Install the core components:

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6 PyMuPDF sentence-transformers chromadb ollama
    ```

3. **Basic GUI:** Using PyQt, create a simple window with these elements:
      * A button to `Select Folder`.
      * A list view to show which files have been processed.
      * A text input box for the user's question.
      * A button to `Ask`.
      * A text area to display the final answer and its sources.

**Step 2: The Ingestion Pipeline (Processing PDFs)**
This part of the code will "learn" your documents.

1. **File Scanning:** When the user selects a folder, your app should recursively find all `.pdf` files.
2. **Text Extraction:** For each PDF, use **PyMuPDF** to open the file and extract the raw text from every page.
3. **Chunking:** Raw text is too long for an AI model to handle effectively. You need to split the text into smaller, meaningful chunks. A good starting point is to split by paragraphs or by a fixed number of sentences (e.g., 5-7 sentences per chunk with a small overlap).
4. **Embedding & Storing:** For each text chunk:
      * Use the **Sentence-Transformers** model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert the text chunk into a vector embedding (a list of numbers).
      * Store this embedding in **ChromaDB**. Critically, you must also store the original text of the chunk and its **metadata**: the source filename and the page number. This metadata is how you will provide citations.

**Step 3: The Query Pipeline (Answering Questions)**
This is the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process in action.

1. **User Query:** The user types a question into the GUI and clicks `Ask`.

2. **Embed the Query:** Use the *same* sentence-transformer model to convert the user's question into a vector embedding.

3. **Retrieve Relevant Context:** Query **ChromaDB** with the question's embedding. ChromaDB will perform a similarity search and return the top 3-5 most relevant text chunks from your documents based on semantic meaning.

4. **Augment the Prompt:** You now have the necessary ingredients. Programmatically construct a detailed prompt for the LLM. This is a critical step. Use a template like this:

    ``` text
    Based *only* on the context provided below, please answer the user's question. For each piece of information you use, you must cite the source file and page number.

    Context:
    ---
    Source: [document_1.pdf, Page: 5]
    Content: [Relevant text chunk 1...]
    ---
    Source: [document_2.pdf, Page: 12]
    Content: [Relevant text chunk 2...]
    ---
    Source: [document_1.pdf, Page: 8]
    Content: [Relevant text chunk 3...]
    ---

    Question: [User's actual question...]

    Answer:
    ```

5. **Generate the Answer:** Send this complete prompt to your locally running **Ollama** model (e.g., Llama 3) via its API. The LLM will read the context and formulate an answer based on it. Because you instructed it to use *only* the provided context and to cite sources, it will generate a factual, verifiable answer.

6. **Display Results:** Show the LLM's answer and the cited sources in your application's UI.

-----

### **Phase 2: Upgrading Your Application**

Once you have the core functionality working, you can move on to the more advanced features you envisioned.

#### **Handling Images, Charts, and Graphs**

To make your application understand visual data, you'll need a **multimodal model**.

* **Tech Addition:** Use a model like **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)**, which can also be run locally via Ollama.
* **Implementation:**
    1. During your ingestion step (Phase 1, Step 2), use **PyMuPDF** not just to extract text, but also to extract images from each page.
    2. For each extracted image, send it to the LLaVA model with a prompt like "Describe this image in detail."
    3. Take the text description generated by LLaVA and treat it as another piece of text from that page.
    4. Create an embedding for this description and store it in ChromaDB along with the text chunks.
    <!-- end list -->
  * **Result:** When a user asks "What was the revenue trend in Q3?", the retrieval system can now find the text description of the revenue chart you processed, providing the necessary context for the LLM to answer.

#### **Expanding to Other Document Formats**

This is a straightforward extension of your ingestion pipeline.

* **Tech Additions:** Add libraries like `python-docx` for `.docx` files, `beautifulsoup4` for `.html`, etc.
* **Implementation:**
    1. Modify your file-scanning logic to recognize different extensions (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`).
    2. Create a simple "dispatcher" function that calls the correct library to extract text based on the file type.
    <!-- end list -->
  * **Result:** The rest of your pipelineâ€”chunking, embedding, storing, and queryingâ€”remains exactly the same. You've just made the "text extraction" part more versatile.

This phased approach allows you to achieve a useful result quickly while building a solid foundation for a highly capable and private AI application. Good luck with your project\!

## Packaging and Distribution Plan

### **Packaging and Distribution Plan**

This section covers how to turn your development project into a standalone application that non-technical users can easily run.

#### **The Challenge: Removing External Dependencies**

A non-technical user cannot be expected to install and run a command-line tool like Ollama. The goal is a "double-click to run" experience. This requires a shift in technology from the development phase.

#### **The Solution: Integrated LLM and Packaging**

* **Distribution LLM Runner: `llama-cpp-python`**
  * **What it is:** A Python library that allows you to load and run specially formatted LLM files (with a `.gguf` extension) *directly within your Python code*.
  * **Its Purpose:** This **replaces the need for Ollama** in your final application. It's like embedding the LLM's brain directly into your app, making it truly self-contained.

* **Packaging Tool: PyInstaller**
  * **What it is:** A powerful tool that analyzes your Python project and "shrink-wraps" your script, all its library dependencies, and the Python interpreter itself into a single executable file (`.exe` for Windows, `.app` for Mac).
  * **Its Purpose:** This creates the final, distributable application file that users can simply double-click to install and run without any setup.

#### **Action Plan for Distribution**

1. **Refactor Your Code:** Modify your query logic. Replace the API call to the Ollama server with direct calls to the `llama-cpp-python` library. You will load the model directly from a file path.

2. **Implement a Model Downloader:** The LLM model files (`.gguf`) are several gigabytes and should not be included in the installer. Instead:
    * On the application's first launch, check if the model file exists in a user-specific data directory.
    * If it doesn't, display a "First-Time Setup" window in your GUI.
    * Programmatically download the required `.gguf` model from a source like **Hugging Face Hub**, making sure to **show a progress bar** so the user knows what's happening.

3. **Create the Executable:** Once your code is refactored and the downloader is in place, use **PyInstaller** to package your application. A typical command would be:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --name "DocuMind" --windowed --onefile your_main_script.py
    ```

4. **Test Thoroughly:** Test the final executable on clean machines (both Windows and Mac) that have never had Python or any of these tools installed to ensure the entire process works as expected for a new user.

By following this comprehensive plan, you will not only learn the fundamentals of building an AI application but also gain the practical skills needed to package and share your creation with others.
